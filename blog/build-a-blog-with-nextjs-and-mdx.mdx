## Introduction 
In this article we will learning about implement MDX to our Next.js project.

<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank">Markdown</a>is a simple markup language for formatting text. It enables you to write in plain text syntax and turn it into structurally valid HTML. It is extensively used for producing stuff for websites and blogs. 

```tsx
I **enjoy** using Next.js and MDX
```

```tsx
Output: 
<p>I <strong>enjoy</strong> using Next.js and MDX</p>
```

<a href="https://mdxjs.com/" target="_blank">MDX </a> is a superset of markdown that allows you to write JSX directly in your markdown files. It's an effective solution for incorporating dynamic interaction and React components into your content.
Next.js can handle both local MDX content in your application and external MDX files retrieved dynamically from the server. The Next.js plugin transforms markdown and React components to HTML and supports Server Components (which are the default in App Router).

The **@next/mdx** package is used to modify Next.js to support markdown and MDX. It takes data from local files, allowing you to create pages with the.mdx extension in your /pages or /app directories.

Let's walk through how to configure and use MDX with Next.js.

## Installation and setup
We will start by installing packages needed to render MDX:

```tsx
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
```

### Creating mdx-components.tsx
In the main directory of your application (src/ or the app/), you must create a file called **mdx-components.tsx** as it is necessary for MDX with App Router to work correctly.

``` tsx
// mdx-components.tsx

import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
    return {
        ...components,
    }
}
```
### Updating next.config.js
Update the **next.config.js** file located at your project's root directory to configure it to use MDX. This will enable you to take advantage of MDX's powerful features and enhance your project with dynamic and interactive content.

``` tsx
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')()
 
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Configure `pageExtensions` to include MDX files
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below
}
 
module.exports = withMDX(nextConfig)
```


## Creating our first .mdx file
We will begin by creating a new MDX page within the /app directory of our project. This also involves creating a page.mdx file within the specified directory.

```tsx
your-project  
├── app  
│   └── my-mdx-page  
│       └── page.mdx  
└── package.json
```

Now, you can use markdown inside your MDX page, giving you even more flexibility and control over your content creation process.

```jsx
// page.mdx
# Welcome to my MDX page!

This is paragraph
This is some **bold** and *emphasis* text.

This is a list in markdown:
- One
- Two
- Three
```

The above mdx file will be transformed into the following html file through the rendering process.

```html
<h1>Welcome to my MDX page!</h1>

<p>This is paragraph</p>
<p>This is some <strong>bold</strong> and <em>emphasis</em> text.</p>

<p>This is a list in markdown:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One</li>
    <li>Two</li>
    <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

## Local MDX
When using a local file as an mdx from your project folder, you can easily access and work with the content in a convenient manner.

```tsx
your-project  
├── app 
│   └── blog  
│       └── page.tsx
└── blogs  
    └── blog-01.mdx  
```
We are in the process of creating a new directory specifically intended for blogs, where we will conveniently store our .mdx files. These files will then be rendered in our blog's page.tsx file.

```tsx
// blog-01.mdx

# Welcome to my MDX blog-01!

This is paragraph
This is some **bold** and _italics_ text.
This is a list in markdown:
- One
- Two
- Three
```

```tsx
// blog/page.tsx

import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

export default async function RemoteMdxPage() {
    // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, CMS, fetch, anywhere...
    const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'blogs', 'blog-01.mdx');

    // Read the contents of the MDX file
    const src = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');

    return <MDXRemote source={src} />   
}
```
The code creates a Next.js page component called **RemoteMdxPage**, and it makes use of the **next-mdx-remote** library. 

This component asynchronously retrieves the content of an MDX file from the 'blogs' directory. The MDX content is then displayed using the **MDXRemote** component, allowing for the dynamic loading and rendering of MDX content from various sources such as local files or databases. 

The **MDXRemote** component manages the conversion and display of the MDX source as React components. This configuration makes it easier to build adaptable and **dynamic pages** with MDX content in a Next.js application.

## Dynamic routes

When you are unsure of the specific segment names in advance and need to generate routes from dynamic data, you can utilize Dynamic Segments. These can be filled in at the time of the request or pre-rendered during the build process.

Suppose we have a list of blogs:
```tsx
your-project  
└── blogs  
    └── blog-01.mdx  
    └── blog-02.mdx 
    └── blog-03.mdx 
```

When the link **/blog/blog-01** is clicked, we want to display the contents of the **blog-01.mdx** file. Likewise, when the link **/blog/blog-02** is clicked, we want to display the contents of **blog-02.mdx**, and so forth.

{/* A Dynamic Segment is created by enclosing a folder's name in square brackets, such as **[folderName]**, for instance **[id]** or [**slug**]. Dynamic Segments are passed as the params prop to layout, page, route, and generateMetadata functions.

For instance, in a blog, a route could be structured as **app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx**, where [**slug**] represents the Dynamic Segment for blog posts. */}

The **params** props can be used to access the slug of the current blog that is to be rendered within the application, refer to the example given below

```tsx
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) 
{  
    return <div>My Post: {params.slug}</div>
}
```

```tsx
npm install next-mdx-remote
```

After obtaining the value of params.slug from the request, we can save it to a different variable called "id" and then proceed to display the corresponding mdx file on the web page.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

const Blog = ({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) => {
    const id = params.slug

    const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'blogs', `${id}.mdx`);

    const src = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');

    return (
        <>
            <main className='mx-auto max-w-3xl px-6 lg:px-8 py-10'>
                <article className='my-10'>
                    <MDXRemote source={src} />
                </article>
            </main>
        </>
    )
}

export default Blog
```

## Integrating Gray-matter
```tsx
npm install --save gray-matter
```

```tsx

```

```tsx
import matter from 'gray-matter';
import Image from 'next/image';

const Blog = ({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) => {
    const id = params.slug

    const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'blogs', `${id}.mdx`);

    const srco = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    const { data, content } = matter(srco);
    const value = data;
    const src = content;

    return (
        <>
            <main className='mx-auto max-w-3xl px-6 lg:px-8 py-10'>
                <div>
                    <h1 className='text-center my-4'>{value.title}</h1>
                    <Image
                        src={value.image}
                        width={1080}
                        height={680}
                        alt='featured image'
                        className='rounded-2xl'
                    />
                </div>
                <article className='blog my-10'>
                    <MDXRemote source={src} />
                </article>
            </main>
        </>
    )
}

export default Blog
```
