In the bustling world of online transactions, ensuring a seamless payment experience is paramount for any business. Razorpay, a robust payment gateway, offers a comprehensive solution tailored for developers. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of integrating Razorpay into a Next.js 14 project, step by step.

### Step 1. Creating a Razorpay Account and Obtaining API Keys
To kickstart your journey with Razorpay, the first step is to create an account on their platform. Visit the Razorpay website and proceed with the registration process. 
Once registered, navigate to the dashboard where you'll find your API keys. These keys serve as the bridge between your application and Razorpay's infrastructure, enabling secure payment processing.

### 2. Next.js 14 Project Initialization and Razorpay Installation
Before diving into Razorpay integration, ensure you have a Next.js 14 project set up. If you haven't already initialized your Next.js project, you can do so using the following command:

```jsx
npx create-next-app@14 my-next-app
```

Once your project is set up, navigate to its directory and install the Razorpay package using npm or yarn:
```jsx
cd my-next-app
```

```jsx
npm install razorpay
# or
yarn add razorpay
```

### 3. Building a Simple Payment Component
Let's create a basic "Pay Now" component using Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS. This component will serve as the user interface for initiating payments. Start by creating a new file, e.g., PaymentComponent.js, and add the following code:

```tsx
// PaymentComponent.js
"use client"
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const PaymentComponent = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');
    const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState('');

    return (
        <section className="min-h-[94vh] flex flex-col gap-6 h-14 mx-5 sm:mx-10 2xl:mx-auto 2xl:w-[1400px] items-center pt-36 ">
            <form
                className="flex form flex-col gap-6 w-full sm:w-80"
                onSubmit={processPayment}
            >
                {/* Input fields for name, email, and amount */}
                <div className="space-y-1">
                    <label htmlFor="name" >Your name</label>
                    <input
                        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
                        value={name}
                        type="name"
                        id="name"
                        placeholder="name"
                        required />
                </div>
                {/* More input fields */}
                
                <button type="submit" className='bg-blue-500 text-white font-semibold rounded-2xl w-24 mx-auto text-lg py-2'>
                    Pay
                </button>
            </form>
        </section>
    );
};

export default PaymentComponent;
```

### 4. Creating an API Route for Order Creation
In your Next.js project, set up an API route to handle order creation on the server side. This route will interact with Razorpay's API to generate orders securely. Create a new file, e.g., order.js, inside the app/api directory and add the following code:

```tsx
// pages/api/order.js

import Razorpay from 'razorpay';
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

const razorpay = new Razorpay({
    key_id: process.env.RAZORPAY_ID!,
    key_secret: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY,
});

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
    try {
        const { amount, currency } = (await request.json()) as {
            amount: string;
            currency: string;
        };

        const options = {
            amount: amount,
            currency: currency,
            receipt: 'rcp1',
        };

        const order = await razorpay.orders.create(options);
        console.log(order);
        return NextResponse.json({ orderId: order.id }, { status: 200 });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error creating order:', error);
        return NextResponse.error('Internal Server Error', { status: 500 });
    }
}
```
