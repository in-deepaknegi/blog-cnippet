pnpm, short for **performant npm** , is a relatively new package manager for JavaScript projects. It provides various benefits compared to traditional options such as <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/" target="_black">npm</a> and <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started" target="_black">yarn</a>, including quicker installation, efficient use of space through content-addressable storage, and integrated handling of multiple Node.js versions.

This article will guide you through using pnpm to manage dependencies in your Next.js 14 application.

## Installation 
Before we delve into the specifics, let's ensure pnpm is readily available on your system. Here's a convenient way to achieve this:

### Using npm:
We can leverage npm itself to install pnpm globally. Simply run the following command:

```tsx
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Resolving 'pnpm is not recognized' error:

If you encounter this error after installation, you might need to add the pnpm directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This typically involves locating the pnpm installation directory (e.g., *user/user_name/AppData/Local/pnpm* on Windows) and adding it to your PATH.

Once added, verify the installation by running:
```tsx
pnpm -v
```

## Using pnpm to Create a Next.js 14 Project
Creating a new Next.js 14 project with pnpm is straightforward:

```tsx
pnpm create next-app@latest
```

This command utilizes the **pnpm create** functionality and specifies the **next-app template** with the @latest version tag, ensuring you get the newest Next.js version. The process is very similar to using npm or yarn for project creation.

## Using pnpm in an Existing Next.js Project (Previously Managed with npm)
If you have an existing Next.js project currently managed by npm, you can migrate to pnpm. Here's how:

1. **Use npx npkill**: to remove all globally installed npm packages, including dependencies from your project.

```tsx
npx npkill
```

2. **Install pnpm Dependencies**: Run pnpm i to install all the project dependencies using pnpm. 

```tsx
pnpm i 
```

3. **Frozen Lockfile (Optional)**: If you want to prevent accidental changes to the pnpm-lock.yaml file (pnpm's equivalent of package-lock.json), you can use the --frozen-lockfile flag with the install command:

```tsx
pnpm i --frozen-lockfile
```

## Starting development server with pnpm

Once you've installed pnpm, launching your Next.js 14 development server is a breeze:

1. **Use pnpm dev**: This command is the most straightforward way. It's a shortcut for pnpm run dev, which typically executes a script in your package.json file that starts the server.

```tsx
pnpm dev
```

2. **pnpm run dev** (if script exists): If your package.json has a custom script named "dev" for starting the server, you can use the more verbose version pnpm run dev.

```tsx
pnpm run dev
```
