## Implementing pnpm in a next.js project

* If we have a existing project, first of all we need to delete the old node_modules File, this can be done using the following command:

```tsx
npx npkill
```

* Install pnpm package
```tsx
pnpm i 
```

* error 'pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with package.json'
```tsx
pnpm i --frozen-lockfile
```

* proceed with, git add -> git commit
